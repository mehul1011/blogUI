            <p>I'm a full stack developer (Angular, NextJS (Node.js), .NET) with a focus on creating (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences that are fast, accessible, visually appealing, and responsive. Even though I have been creating web applications for over 7 years, I still love it as if it was something new.</p>

                    <h2>Curious about me? Here you have it:</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.</p>
        <p>I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.</p>
